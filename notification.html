<p>This page exist with the sole objective of doing test with the chrome.notification API.</p>
<p>There are two buttons for your pleasure. The "Notification" buttom use the Notification API. These do not work well stacking. The labeled "Extension API" doesn't have option to control the timeout, so none of our settings will work.</p>
<button class="notification">Notification</button>
<button class="extension">Extension API</button>
